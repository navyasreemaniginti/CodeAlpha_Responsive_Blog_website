                        <h4>Project Management</h4>
                        <p>
                            Building on the success of the Lean-based approaches in product development, construction and agile development, we believe that the future of project management is Lean.
                            Project Management has undergone a long evolution, yet it still faces many challenges and brings inconsistent results.In recent decades, we’ve witnessed disruptive innovations in this area but the traditional understanding of how and why we should manage projects, and the uncertainty it often creates, still prevails.
                            The time has come for significant changes that need to start with rethinking the definition of a project and the role of project management. Therefore, we decided to introduce you to our new project management framework by explaining our Manifesto on Projects and Project Management.</p>
